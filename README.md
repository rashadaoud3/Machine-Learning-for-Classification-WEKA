# 🤖 Machine Learning for Classification (WEKA)

This repository contains an **Artificial Intelligence course project** that applies **machine learning** techniques for classification tasks using **WEKA**. The project compares three classification models on the **Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset** and analyzes their performance.

## 🎯 Project Goal:
To test and compare different **machine learning classification algorithms** using WEKA, evaluating their performance based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## 📊 Dataset:
- **Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset**  
- Contains various speech features for accent classification.  
- Preprocessing includes **attribute discretization** to improve model performance.  

## 🏆 Tested Classification Models:
✔ **Decision Tree**  
✔ **Naïve Bayes**  
✔ **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  

## 🔬 Experiment Setup:
